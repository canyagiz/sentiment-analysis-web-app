# Sentiment Analysis MLOps Project

## 🚀 Overview
This project implements a production-ready sentiment analysis system using modern MLOps practices. The system is built with a microservices architecture, separating the machine learning backend from the user interface frontend, and is designed for scalable deployment using containerization and Kubernetes orchestration.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The project is structured into two main components:
1. Backend service for ML model serving
2. Frontend service for user interaction

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**:
  - PyTorch for sentiment analysis model
  - FastAPI for REST API endpoints
  - Docker for containerization
  - Kubernetes for orchestration
- **Frontend**:
  - Streamlit for interactive web interface
  - Docker for containerization
  - Kubernetes for deployment
